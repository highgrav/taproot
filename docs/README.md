# Taproot: An opinionated embedded application server

Taproot is designed to be a "batteries-included" application server that can be embedded within any Go application. By 
providing a set of opinionated middleware, sane defaults, and support for various forms of development, Taproot is 
intended to make small-to-medium-sized app server development faster, simpler, and more convenient, while maximizing 
transparency and developer flexibility. It fills a role between traditional Go web development frameworks on the one 
side, and heavyweight application servers on the other.

TAPROOT IS ALPHA SOFTWARE, AND MAY CHANGE WITHOUT WARNING.
