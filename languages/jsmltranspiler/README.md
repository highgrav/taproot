## JSML to JS Transpiler

Technically, there's nothing JS-specific about JSML; it's largely just a markup language that lets you mix semantic tags 
with non-semantic XML (generally HTML) tags. However, Taproot assumes that you're using it within its existing 
JavaScript capabilities, so the transpiler in this directory is the standard target for JSML parse trees.
